ABC constructs a kernel-type approximation to the posterior distribution through an accept/reject mechanism which compares summary statistics of real and simulated data. To obviate the need for summary statistics, we directly compare empirical distributions with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence estimator obtained via contrastive learning. In particular, we blend flexible machine learning classifiers within ABC to automate fake/real data comparisons. We consider the traditional accept/reject kernel as well as an exponential weighting scheme which does not require the ABC acceptance threshold. Our theoretical results show that the rate at which our ABC posterior distributions concentrate around the true parameter depends on the estimation error of the classifier. We derive limiting posterior shape results and find that, with a properly scaled exponential kernel, asymptotic normality holds. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on simulated examples as well as real data in the context of stock volatility estimation.","tags":null,"title":"Approximate Bayesian Computation via Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuexi Wang","Veronika Rockova"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661299200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661299200,"objectID":"a0845afeafeace2034cf46f5c594aa4b","permalink":"https://yuexiwang.github.io/publication/abs/","publishdate":"2022-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/abs/","section":"publication","summary":"In the absence of explicit or tractable likelihoods, Bayesians often resort to approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) for inference. Our work bridges ABC with deep neural implicit samplers based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and adversarial variational Bayes. Both ABC and GANs   compare aspects of observed and fake data to simulate from posteriors  and likelihoods, respectively. We develop a Bayesian GAN (B-GAN) sampler that directly targets the posterior by solving an adversarial optimization problem. B-GAN is driven by a deterministic mapping learned on the ABC reference by conditional GANs. Once the mapping has been trained, iid posterior samples are obtained by filtering noise at a negligible additional cost. We propose two post-processing local refinements using (1) data-driven proposals with importance reweighing, and (2) variational Bayes. We support our findings with frequentist-Bayesian results, showing that the typical total variation distance between the true and approximate  posteriors converges to zero for certain neural network generators and discriminators. Our findings on simulated data show highly competitive performance relative to some of the most recent  likelihood-free posterior simulators.","tags":null,"title":"Adversarial Bayesian Simulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuexi Wang","Nicholas G Polson","Vadim Sokolov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1660521600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660521600,"objectID":"53cd934fbd2913e6fe3818d580844182","permalink":"https://yuexiwang.github.io/publication/da-dl/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/da-dl/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep Learning (DL)  methods have emerged as one of the most powerful tools for  functional approximation and prediction. While the representation properties of DL have been well studied, uncertainty quantification remains challenging and largely unexplored. Data augmentation techniques are a natural approach to provide uncertainty  quantification and to incorporate  stochastic Monte Carlo search into stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods. The purpose of our paper is to show that training DL architectures with data augmentation leads to efficiency gains. We use the theory of scale mixtures of normals to derive data augmentation strategies for deep learning. This allows variants of the expectation-maximization and MCMC algorithms to be brought to bear on these high dimensional nonlinear deep learning models. To demonstrate our methodology, we develop  data augmentation algorithms for a variety of commonly used activation functions such as logit, ReLU, leaky ReLU and SVM. Our methodology is compared to traditional stochastic gradient descent with  back-propagation. Our optimization procedure leads to a version of iteratively re-weighted least squares and can be implemented at scale with accelerated linear algebra methods  providing substantial improvement in speed. We illustrate our methodology on a number of standard datasets.  Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.","tags":null,"title":"Data Augmentation for Bayesian Deep Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yi Liu","Veronika Rockova","Yuexi Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613433600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613433600,"objectID":"0e145f097f841ca2c548bcf34210fcf5","permalink":"https://yuexiwang.github.io/publication/abcforest/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/abcforest/","section":"publication","summary":"Few problems in statistics are as perplexing as variable selection in the presence of very many redundant covariates. The variable selection problem is most familiar in parametric environments such as the linear model or additive variants thereof. In this work, we abandon the linear model framework, which can be quite detrimental when the covariates impact the outcome in a non-linear way, and turn to tree-based methods for variable selection. Such variable screening is traditionally done by pruning down large trees or by ranking variables based on some importance measure. Despite heavily used in practice, these ad-hoc selection rules are not yet well understood from a theoretical point of view. In this work, we devise a Bayesian tree-based probabilistic method and show that it is consistent for variable selection when the regression surface is a smooth mix of p\u003en covariates. These results are the first model selection consistency results for Bayesian forest priors. Probabilistic assessment of variable importance is made feasible by a spike-and-slab wrapper around sum-of-trees priors. Sampling from posterior distributions over trees is inherently very difficult. As an alternative to MCMC, we propose ABC Bayesian Forests, a new ABC sampling method based on data-splitting that achieves higher ABC acceptance rate. We show that the method is robust and successful at finding variables with high marginal inclusion probabilities. Our ABC algorithm provides a new avenue towards approximating the median probability model in non-parametric setups where the marginal likelihood is intractable.","tags":null,"title":"Variable Selection with ABC Bayesian Forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuexi Wang","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Statistical theoretical developments have been mostly concerned with approximability or rates of estimation when recovering infinite dimensional objects (curves or densities). Despite the impressive array of available theoretical results, the literature has been largely silent about uncertainty quantification for deep learning. This paper takes a step forward in this important direction by taking a Bayesian point of view. We study Gaussian approximability of certain aspects of posterior distributions of sparse deep ReLU architectures in non-parametric regression. Building on tools from Bayesian non-parametrics, we provide semi-parametric Bernstein-von Mises theorems for linear and quadratic functionals, which guarantee that implied Bayesian credible regions have valid frequentist coverage. Our results provide new theoretical justifications for (Bayesian) deep learning with ReLU activation functions, highlighting their inferential potential.","tags":null,"title":"Uncertainty Quantification for Sparse Deep Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.
